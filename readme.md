Project Description:

Website for a new Cafe that will serve the following purposes:
1) A description of who designed the cafe and what they believe they can offer to the public vs other similiar businesses in the area.
2) Users will be able to view beautiful images of the beverages and food that they offer, creating a sense of intrigue.
3) Users will easily be able to navigate to the location using the maps feature, and know what times the cafe is available with the hours of operation. 
4) Users will be able to sign up for monthly coupons and a free birthday pastry by filling out the form. They will receive either a text message and / or an email with the coupons, depending on their selections.
